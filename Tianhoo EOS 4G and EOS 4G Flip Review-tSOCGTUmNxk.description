Tianhoo EOS 4G and EOS 4G Flip Review. The Tianhoo EOS 4G and EOS 4G Flip are decent devices that could have been a bit better if Tianhoo made sure that the build quality matched their pricing. The EOS 4G and EOS 4G Flip phones are marketed towards seniors, but they lack in durability and not so impressive software on the android basic phone arena. Tianhoo is an option, but not the best one out there.
